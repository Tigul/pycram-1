    "# Location Designator\n",
    "This example will show you what location designators are, how to use them and what they are capable of. \n",
    "\n",
    "Location Designators are used to semantically describe locations in the world. You could, for example, create a location designator that describes every position where a robot can be placed without colliding with the environment. Location designator can describe locations for:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Visibility \n",
    "   * Reachability\n",
    "   * Occupancy \n",
    "   * URDF Links (for example a table)\n",
    "\n",
    "To find locations that fit the given constrains, location designator create Costmaps. Costmaps are a 2D distribution that have a value greater than 0 for every position that fits the costmap criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Location designators work similar to other designators, meaning you have to create a location designator description which describes the location. This description can then be resolved to the actual 6D pose on runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Occupancy\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with a simple location designator that describes a location where the robot can be placed without colliding with the environment. To do this we need a BulletWorld since the costmaps are mostly created from the current state of the BulletWorld. "
