    "# PyCram KnowRob Demo\n",
    "This demo shows how to use PyCram with the KnowRob reasoning framework to infer knowledge about the world on demand. The scenario is a PR2 robot in the IAI apartment lab which has the task of setting the table for a breakfast. To achieve this the robot has to find a milk bottle in the apartment and transport it to the table as well as a bowl and a spoon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The robot is only given the types of the objects and the final pose on the table and has to figure out the exact objects and their poses by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start the demo by setting up the scene with the PR2 robot, the apartment and the milk bottle. Afterwards, we will bring the robot into an initial state by parking its arms and moving the torso to a high position."
